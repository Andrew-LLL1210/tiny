## Installation

### Option 1: Prebuilt Binary

Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/Andrew-LLL1210/tiny/releases)
to see if there is a prebuilt binary for your system. Currently I provide
binaries for x86_64 Windows, Mac, and Linux. If you need a different
architecture or OS, file an issue and I can compile a binary for you.

### Option 2: Build from Source

Requires [Zig 0.14.0 (dev)](https://github.com/ziglang/zig)

```
> git clone https://github.com/Andrew-LLL1210/tiny
> cd tiny
> zig build
```
